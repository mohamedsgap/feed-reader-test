### Testing!

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development." This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.
Writing effective tests requires analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript - an extremely important skill when changing teams or joining a new company.
Good tests give  the ability to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within your codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality.
